Just walked out of the theater, and man, Gap got me in all sorts of ways. You know when you're not sure if you want to punch a wall or hug a stranger? Yeah, that’s where I’m at. First thing: that opening scene — like, did I just accidentally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a fever dream? I was genuinely expecting unicorns to pop out at any moment yelling, Surprise!

So there's this one guy, Mike, I think his name was? Could anyone be less decisive?? Feels like they couldn’t even decide on giving him a decent haircut. Got me wondering if I should start carrying clippers just in case I meet people like him. I swear, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 him think is like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 paint dry while someone tells you it's actually really fascinating if you squint the right way. But then, who am I kidding, I’m a sucker and stayed glued to his every awkward, mind-losing misstep. I still don't know why.

> That part with the train! Like, were we supposed to be having an existential crisis or be scared for our lives? I’m sitting there with one eye on my popcorn — like, is it gonna leap out of my hand? Just checkin. The whole cityscape thing was this bizarre love child of a ‘90s video game and an armchair philosopher's night out. Seriously, the visuals had me digging deep into my pocket universe of confusion. If Alice had a gaming system in her Wonderland, she’d be playing this.

And that music!! My ears don't know whether to send a thank-you note or a cease and desist letter. It's like someone took a blender to a symphony orchestra and hit frappe. But, don't get me wrong, I kinda loved it in that “Please make it stop but also don’t” way — a cat negotiating its way into the kitchen while claiming it doesn’t need you.

```csharp
int mindBlown = 0;
while(mindBlown < 1) {
    Console.WriteLine(Is this real life?);
}
```

Honestly, Gap is a trip — and not always the fun kind. It’s like those dreams where you're falling and then seabirds start singing your taxes. Not saying it didn’t have its moments, but you might wanna have something calming handy after. Maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Or don’t. Or pretend you did and mind the gap in logic.
